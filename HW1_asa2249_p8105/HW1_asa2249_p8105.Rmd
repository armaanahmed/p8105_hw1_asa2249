# This is a script for HW1 for BIST8105, Data Science, taught by Professor Jeff Goldsmith. In this script, I will demonstrate usage of R Markdown, GitHub for version control, and the use of R Projects.

Problem 1
```{r Problem_1a, echo=TRUE}
# I decided to set echo to true, so you can see both my code and the results in
# the knitted HTML file.

# problem1_DF is a data frame that consists of various data types, including a
# standard normal distribution of numbers, boolean values, character and factor
# vectors.

problem1_DF = 
  tibble(
    normal_distribution_values = rnorm(10),
    logical_vector = normal_distribution_values>0,
    charactor_vector_10 = c("go", "on", "I", "know", "it", "not", "me", "not", "hermoine", "YOU"),
    factor_vector_10 = factor(c("harry", "hermoine", "ron", "ron", "ron", "hermoine", "harry", "hermoine", "harry", "ron"))
  )

# generates a table of problem1_DF to inspect whether values have successfully
# been input
view(problem1_DF, n = 10)

# Take the mean of each set of values in the dataframe

# Take the mean of the normally distributed 10 values that were generated
ndist_mean = mean(problem1_DF %>% pull(1))
ndist_mean
#ndist_mean = ~-0.228, which is about what we would expect

# Take the mean of the logical vector
logvec_mean = mean(problem1_DF %>% pull(2))
logvec_mean
# logvec_mean = 0.3, which assumes TRUE = 1, and FALSE = 0.

# Take the mean of the character vector
chvec_mean = mean(problem1_DF %>% pull(3))
chvec_mean

# Take the mean of the factor vector
factor_mean = mean(problem1_DF %>% pull(4))
factor_mean
```

this code chunk converts logical, character and factor variables into a numeric type, derived from the problem1_DF dataframe and using the as.numeric function.



```{r Problem_1b,eval = FALSE}
# eval is set to false to show the chunk, not the output
# Convert the logical vector into a numeric type
logical_vector = problem1_DF %>% pull(2)
logical_vector_numeric = as.numeric(logical_vector)
logvec_mean_num = mean(logical_vector_numeric)
logvec_mean_num
# logvec_mean_num = 0.4 (this varies depending on the run), which assumes TRUE
# = 1, and FALSE = 0. This is the same as before, because R interprets booleans
# as TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0.

# Convert the character vector into a numeric type
charactor_vector = problem1_DF %>% pull(3)
charactor_vector_numeric = as.numeric(charactor_vector)
character_vector_mean_num = mean(charactor_vector_numeric)
character_vector_mean_num
# character_vector_mean_num =


# Convert the factor vector into a numeric type
factor_vector = problem1_DF %>% pull(4)
factor_vector_numeric = as.numeric(factor_vector)
factor_vector_mean_num = mean(factor_vector_numeric)
factor_vector_mean_num
# factor_vector_mean_num = 2.1, because as.numeric converts the charactor 
# factor vector values into 1, 2, 3 (or levels), which we can now take the mean
# of. 

```


Problem 2
```{r Problem_2, echo = TRUE}
#load the penguins dataset
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

#determine some summary statistics about the penguins dataset
summary(penguins)
#running the summary function, we see that there are three species (Adelie, 
# Chinstrap, and Gentoo) and three islands (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen). There 
# are 152 Adelie penguins, 68 Chinstrap penguins. Other variables of interest 
# include the average bill length and bill depth, flipper length, body mass, 
# penguin sex and year of observation.
head(penguins)

#the number of rows and columns in the penguins dataset
num_columns = ncol(penguins)
num_columns
num_rows = nrow(penguins)
num_rows
#there are 344 rows and 8 columns in the penguins dataset.

#the mean flipper length
flipper_length_mm = penguins %>% pull(3) %>% na.omit()
flipper_length_mm_mean = mean(flipper_length_mm)
flipper_length_mm_mean
 
#the mean flipper length of the penguins in this dataset is 43.92193mm
```

```{r problem_2_plot, echo = TRUE}
# generate a scatterplot of bill_length_mm (x) vs flipper_length_mm (y), with 
# points colored by species
flipper_plot = ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y =flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Flipper Length vs Bill Length \n by Penguin Species") + xlab("Bill Length (mm)") + ylab("Flipper Length (mm)")
plot(flipper_plot)

#save the scatterplot
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
